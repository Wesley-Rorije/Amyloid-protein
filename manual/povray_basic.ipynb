    "# Basic Povray Simulation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This document describes the most basic usage of the **povray_simulation** Python package that is provided for this course. This library is used to render (*draw*) objects and create animations/ simulations using the Povray ray-tracer (http://www.povray.org). Please briefly read the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics) document for a basic understanding of ray-tracing as it describes the elements we need to create an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "The code included in this document requires a number of Python libraries which are listed in the [requirements.txt](https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/requirements.txt) file available on the `povray_simulation` repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular example only uses a few of those dependencies, the first one being the [`vapory`](https://github.com/Zulko/vapory) library. This library translates our Python code for creating objects (spheres, cubes, cylinders, etc.) into Povray code. From this library we import the `Sphere` object for drawing a - you guessed it - *sphere*. The `Scene` object can be described as a 'container' that we put all objects in to render (i.e. a camera, lightsources and for this example, a sphere). "

If you run the line below in Python Idle you can see which functions and objects are available with the `dir(povray)` command."
